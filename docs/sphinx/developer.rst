Developer tips
--------------

Compiling Hermes-3 quickly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After compiling Hermes-3 and changing something, you can avoid unnecessary recompilation of 
unchanged files. Simply enter the build directory and do:

.. code-block:: bash

   make -j 4

Where ``4`` will make it compile using 4 cores. You can increase or decrease this as necessary.
Sometimes, CMake will think that it needs to recompile parts of BOUT++ even if it wasn't changed.
To stop this try adding the flag ``-DHERMES_UPDATE_GIT_SUBMODULE=OFF`` in your CMake command.
This and other useful options can be found in ``hermes-3/CMakeLists.txt``.

Compiling documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Hermes-3 documentation is built using `Sphinx <https:
//www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html>`_ and 
`Doxygen <https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html>`_. It's written in 
`ReStructuredText (RST) <https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/reStructuredText/>`_, 
which is a markup language similar to Markdown. Doxygen generates automatic 
documentation based on the C++ code, while Sphinx handles everything else.

Editing documentation is much easier if you can compile it locally using the following steps:

1. **Install Sphinx** and our theme in your Python environment:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install sphinx sphinx_book_theme

2. **Install Doxygen** (modify as necessary for your OS) and Breathe, the package that
   connects it to Sphinx:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt install doxygen

3. **Install Breathe** (modify as necessary for your OS):

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install breathe

4. **Run Doxygen** - this will parse the C++ code:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd hermes-3/docs/doxygen
      Doxygen doxyfile

5. **Run Sphinx** - this will parse the RST files and generate the
   documentation. ``sphinx`` and ``build`` are the source and build
   directories, respectively.

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd hermes-3/docs
      sphinx-build sphinx build

6. **Open the generated HTML files**, either by double clicking on the file in your
   browser, or some other way. If you use VS Code locally or on a remote
   machine through SSH, you can use the extension `Live Preview <https:
   //marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server>`_ which
   can stream it to your browser.

Debugging: running for one iteration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any BOUT++ code can be run for just one right-hand side (RHS) iteration. This will
run instantly for any simulation and not need any kind of solver convergence, making
it ideal for debugging. 

This can be done by setting the following in the input file:

.. code-block:: ini

   nout = 0

The ``timestep`` setting will be ignored. 

Debugging: printing values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When debugging, it can be useful to print things out. This is simple in C++. 
For example, if you want to print the value of the variable ``particle_flow``, do:

.. code-block:: ini

   output << "\n*******************************\n"
   output << "particle_flow: " << particle_flow << "\n"
   output << "*******************************\n"

Which will result in:

.. code-block:: ini

   *******************************
   particle_flow: 0.123456
   *******************************

Sometimes you need to deal with printing whole fields. In this case, it is useful
to print out every cell value along with its coordinates. The below code snippet will
do this for the variable ``Tn``:

.. code-block:: ini

   or(int ix=0; ix < mesh->LocalNx ; ix++){
      for(int iy=0; iy < mesh->LocalNy ; iy++){
          for(int iz=0; iz < mesh->LocalNz; iz++){

            std::string string_count = std::string("(") + std::to_string(ix) + std::string(",") + std::to_string(iy)+ std::string(",") + std::to_string(iz) + std::string(")");
            output << string_count + std::string(": ") + std::to_string(Tn(ix,iy,iz)) + std::string("; ");
          }
      }
    output << "\n";
    }

The output will look something like:

.. code-block:: bash

   (0,0,0): 0.123456; (0,0,1): 0.654321; (0,0,2): 0.987654; (0,1,0): 0.123456; (0,1,1): 0.654321; (0,1,2): 0.987654;
   (1,0,0): 0.123456; (1,0,1): 0.654321; (1,0,2): 0.987654; (1,1,0): 0.123456; (1,1,1): 0.654321; (1,1,2): 0.987654;
   ...

Note that there are multiple ways to print out values in C++, and both ``std::string(text)`` and ``"text"`` are valid.

Debugging: segmentation faults
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Segmentation faults <https://thelinuxcode.com/segmentation-fault-cpp/>`_ can be frustrating because
they give very little verbosity. In practice, the most common cause is trying to access a variable
that hasn't been initialised yet. The easiest way to debug this is to carefully review the new lines of 
code to make sure all variables exist and have been declared and initialised. If this is tricky,
another simple way is to comment out large parts of the code until the segmentation fault disappears, 
helping to narrow down its location. 

While the above methods are very simple and can be effective, debugging tools such as 
`gdb <https://sourceware.org/gdb/>`_ or `valgrind <https://valgrind.org/>`_ can be used to find 
the segmentation fault as well.

Debugging: compiling in debug mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This can be a useful way to catch errors. Please see the
`relevant page <https://bout-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_docs/advanced_install.html#optimisation-and-run-time-checking>`_ 
in the BOUT++ documentation.

Header vs. implementation files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

C++ allows you to split code into implementation (.cxx) and header (.hxx) files.
The convention of what should be in each one is not consistent in Hermes-3 at
the moment. The most common standard is for the header file to contain all of the
variable and class declarations and the implementation file to contain the rest.
An example of this is in the ``evolve_density`` component - see the
`implementation file <https://github.com/boutproject/hermes-3/blob/master/src/evolve_density.cxx>`_
and the `header file <https://github.com/boutproject/hermes-3/blob/master/include/evolve_density.hxx>`_.



Data types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hermes-3 casts its variables in a variety of BOUT++ classes. Floats are 
usually represented as ``BoutReal``, and fields as ``Field3D``. Note that
Hermes-3 always runs "in 3D" - when configured in 1D, the x and z dimensions
are of unit length. See relevant `BOUT++ docs 
<https://bout-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer_docs/data_types.html>`_ 
for more info. There is also a data type called ``Options`` which is equivalent
to a Python dictionary with extra functionality, and is used to store input
options, the entire simulation state and many other data.


Adding new settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is simple and uses the following syntax:

.. code-block:: ini

   bndry_flux = options["bndry_flux"]
                     .doc("Allow flows through radial boundaries")
                     .withDefault<bool>(true);

See `this real world example 
<https://github.com/boutproject/hermes-3/blob/master/src/evolve_density.cxx>`_.

The variable must also be declared in the corresponding header file.

Adding new diagnostics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adding new diagnostics is also simple, provided there is already an ``outputVars``
function set up in your component. This is usually located at the end of the
implementation file. See this example from ``evolve_momentum.cxx``:

.. code-block:: ini

   void EvolveMomentum::outputVars(Options &state) {
   AUTO_TRACE();
   // Normalisations
   auto Nnorm = get<BoutReal>(state["Nnorm"]);
   auto Omega_ci = get<BoutReal>(state["Omega_ci"]);
   auto Cs0 = get<BoutReal>(state["Cs0"]);

   state[std::string("NV") + name].setAttributes(
         {{"time_dimension", "t"},
         {"units", "kg / m^2 / s"},
         {"conversion", SI::Mp * Nnorm * Cs0},
         {"standard_name", "momentum"},
         {"long_name", name + " parallel momentum"},
         {"species", name},
         {"source", "evolve_momentum"}});

Each diagnostic is saved with metadata, which is available in xHermes, e.g.

.. code-block:: ini

   ds["Nd"].attrs()

time_dimension
   This indicates that the variable is time evolving. If you remove this line,
   it will be saved only at the first RHS evaluation.

units
   A string showing the units for post-processing. xHermes picks this up.

conversion
   A float representing the normalisation factor. xHermes picks this up to do
   automatic conversion to SI units.

standard_name, long_name
   We aren't consistent on what should be in each, but they are meant to describe
   the variables in post-processing.

species, source
   The relevant species and component that the diagnostic is coming from

What is "Options"?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Options is a dictionary-like class originally developed for parsing BOUT++ options.
In Hermes-3, it is used as a general purpose dictionary.

Getting/setting values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hermes-3 has a system to prevent quantities from being modified after they are used.
This is important as it uses a single dictionary-like ``state`` class to hold all of 
the variables in one place, which could allow some components to overwrite others.

In ``component.hxx`` there is the function ``get``, which once called sets the 
"final" and "final-domain" attributes:

.. code-bloc:: ini

   T get(const Options& option, const std::string& location = "") {
   #if CHECKLEVEL >= 1
   // Mark option as final, both inside the domain and the boundary
   const_cast<Options&>(option).attributes["final"] = location;
   const_cast<Options&>(option).attributes["final-domain"] = location;
   #endif
   return getNonFinal<T>(option);
   }

When you call ``set``, these attributes are checked for, so that if they have 
already been "gotten", they can't be set again:

.. code-block:: ini

   Options& set(Options& option, T value) {
   // Check that the value has not already been used
   #if CHECKLEVEL >= 1
   if (option.hasAttribute("final")) {
      throw BoutException("Setting value of {} but it has already been used in {}.",
                           option.name(), option.attributes["final"].as<std::string>());
   }
   if (option.hasAttribute("final-domain")) {
      throw BoutException("Setting value of {} but it has already been used in {}.",
                           option.name(),
                           option.attributes["final-domain"].as<std::string>());
   }

   if (hermesDataInvalid(value)) {
      throw BoutException("Setting invalid value for '{}'", option.str());
   }
   #endif

There is a special use case which allows you to use this "locking" scheme for only
the domain cells, leaving the guard cells to be settable using ``getNoBoundary``:

.. code-block:: ini

   T getNoBoundary(const Options& option, const std::string& location = "") {
   #if CHECKLEVEL >= 1
   // Mark option as final inside the domain
   const_cast<Options&>(option).attributes["final-domain"] = location;
   #endif
   return getNonFinal<T>(option);
   }

And there is a corresponding ``setBoundary`` that can be used for BC operations:

.. code-block:: ini
   
   Options& setBoundary(Options& option, T value) {
   // Check that the value has not already been used
   #if CHECKLEVEL >= 1
   if (option.hasAttribute("final")) {
      throw BoutException("Setting boundary of {} but it has already been used in {}.",
                           option.name(), option.attributes["final"].as<std::string>());
   }
   #endif
   option.force(std::move(value));
   return option;
   }

These functions take a second argument which tells you where they were set, which is easier for debugging.
They are wrapped into additional functions, ``GET_VALUE`` and ``GET_NOBOUNDARY`` which automatically
include this argument.

Please review `component.hxx <https://github.com/boutproject/hermes-3/blob/master/include/component.hxx#L163>`_ 
for more details.


Looping over cells
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BOUT++ provides a really easy way to loop over the domain using ``BOUT_FOR`` and
similar loops, see `BOUT++ docs <https://bout-dev.readthedocs
.io/en/stable/developer_docs/data_types.html#iterating-over-fields>`_.

There is a way to way to tell if you are in the core or not. The ``mesh`` object
has a function to indicate if the coordinate is in a periodic region or not.
Only the core is periodic. See below for an example from ``evolve_pressure.cxx``
which makes sure a pressure source is set to zero outside of the core:

.. code-block:: ini

   if (p_options["source_only_in_core"]
      .doc("Zero the source outside the closed field-line region?")
      .withDefault<bool>(false)) {
    for (int x = mesh->xstart; x <= mesh->xend; x++) {
      if (!mesh->periodicY(x)) {
        // Not periodic, so not in core
        for (int y = mesh->ystart; y <= mesh->yend; y++) {
          for (int z = mesh->zstart; z <= mesh->zend; z++) {
            source(x, y, z) = 0.0;
          }
        }
      }
    }



.. _sec-code_structure:

Code structure
--------------


A hermes-3 model, like all `BOUT++ models
<https://bout-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_docs/physics_models.htmlject.github.io/>`_,
is an implementation of a set of Ordinary Differential Equations
(ODEs). The time integration solver drives the simulation, calling the
`Hermes::rhs` function to calculate the time-derivatives of all the
evolving variables.

The calculation of the time derivatives is coordinated by passing
a state object between components. The state is a nested tree, and
can have values inserted and retrieved by the components. The components
are created and then run by a scheduler, based on settings in the
input (BOUT.inp) file.

For example a transport simulation with deuterium and tritium ions and
atoms has an input file specifying the components

.. code-block:: ini
  
  [hermes]
  components = d+, d, t+, t, e, collisions, sheath_boundary, recycling, reactions

The governing equations for each species are specified e.g.

.. code-block:: ini

  [d+]
  type = evolve_density, evolve_momentum, evolve_pressure, anomalous_diffusion
  AA = 2   # Atomic mass
  charge = 1

and other components have their configuration options e.g. for reactions:

.. code-block:: ini

  [reactions]
  type = (
          d + e -> d+ + 2e,   # Deuterium ionisation
          t + e -> t+ + 2e,   # Tritium ionisation
         )

In terms of design patterns, the method used here is essentially a combination
of the `Encapsulate Context <https://accu.org/journals/overload/12/63/kelly_246/>`_
and `Command <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern>`_ patterns.


Simulation state
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The simulation state is passed between components, and is a tree of
objects (Options objects). At the start of each iteration (rhs call) a
new state is created and contains:

* `time`   BoutReal, the current simulation time
* `linear` bool. True if the time integrator expects a linear response.
* `units`
  
  * `seconds`   Multiply by this to get units of seconds
  * `eV`          Temperature normalisation
  * `Tesla`       Magnetic field normalisation
  * `meters`      Length normalisation
  * `inv_meters_cubed`     Density normalisation

so the temperature normalisation can be extracted using::

  BoutReal Tnorm = state["units"]["eV"];
    
As the components of a model are run, they set, modify and use values
stored in this state. To ensure that components use consistent names
for their input and output variables, a set of conventions are used
for new variables which are added to the state:

* `species`  Plasma species

  * `e`    Electron species
  * `species1`  Example "h", "he+2"

    * `AA`  Atomic mass, proton = 1
    * `charge`  Charge, in units of proton charge (i.e. electron=-1)
    
    * `density`
    * `momentum` Parallel momentum
    * `pressure`
    * `velocity` Parallel velocity
    * `temperature`

    * `collision_frequency`   Normalised collision frequency
    * `density_source`  Normalised particle source 
    * `momentum_source` Normalised momentum source
    * `energy_source`  Normalised energy source

    * `particle_flow_xlow` Normalised particle flow through lower X cell face
    * `particle_flow_ylow` Normalised particle flow through lower Y cell face
    * `momentum_flow_xlow` Normalised momentum flow through lower X cell face
    * `momentum_flow_ylow` Normalised momentum flow through lower Y cell face
    * `energy_flow_xlow`   Normalised energy flow through lower X cell face
    * `energy_flow_ylow`   Normalised energy flow through lower Y cell face

* `fields`

  * `vorticity`
  * `phi`           Electrostatic potential
  * `Apar`          Electromagnetic potential b dot A in induction terms
  * `Apar_flutter`  The electromagnetic potential (b dot A) in flutter terms
  * `DivJdia`       Divergence of diamagnetic current
  * `DivJcol`       Divergence of collisional current
  * `DivJextra`     Divergence of current, including 2D parallel current
                    closures.  Not including diamagnetic, parallel current due to
                    flows, or polarisation currents

For example to get the electron density::

  Field3D ne = state["species"]["e"]["density"];

This way of extracting values from the state will print the value to
the log file, and is intended mainly for initialisation. In
`Component::transform` and `Component::finally` functions which run
frequently, faster access methods are used which don't print to the
log. To get a value::

  Field3D ne = get<Field3D>(state["species"]["e"]["density"]);

If the value isn't set, or can't be converted to the given type,
then a `BoutException` will be thrown.

To set a value in the state, there is the `set` function::

  set(state["species"]["h"]["density"], ne);

A common need is to add or subtract values from fields, such as density sources::

  add(state["species"]["h"]["density_source"], recombination_rate);
  subtract(state["species"]["h+"]["density_source"], recombination_rate);
  
Notes:

- When checking if a subsection exists, use `option.isSection`, since `option.isSet`
  is false if it is a section and not a value.
- The species name convention is that the charge state is last, after the `+` or `-`
  sign: `n2+` is a singly charged nitrogen molecule, while `n+2` is a +2 charged
  nitrogen atom.
  
Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The basic building block of all Hermes-3 models is the
`Component`. This defines an interface to a class which takes a state
(a tree of dictionaries/maps), and transforms (modifies) it.  After
all components have modified the state in turn, all components may
then implement a `finally` method to take the final state but not
modify it. This allows two components to depend on each other, but
makes debugging and testing easier by limiting the places where the
state can be modified.

.. doxygenstruct:: Component
   :members:

Components are usually defined in separate files; sometimes multiple
components in one file if they are small and related to each other (e.g.
atomic rates for the same species). To be able to create components,
they need to be registered in the factory. This is done in the header
file using a code like::

  #include "component.hxx"

  struct MyComponent : public Component {
    MyComponent(const std::string &name, Options &options, Solver *solver);
    ...
  };
  
  namespace {
  RegisterComponent<MyComponent> registercomponentmine("mycomponent");
  }

where `MyComponent` is the component class, and "mycomponent" is the
name that can be used in the BOUT.inp settings file to create a
component of this type. Note that the name can be any string except it
can't contain commas or brackets (), and shouldn't start or end with
whitespace.

Inputs to the component constructors are:

* `name`
* `alloptions`
* `solver`

The `name` is a string labelling the instance. The `alloptions` tree contains at least:

* `alloptions[name]` options for this instance
* `alloptions['units']`
  

Component scheduler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The simulation model is created in `Hermes::init` by a call to the `ComponentScheduler`::

  scheduler = ComponentScheduler::create(options, Options::root(), solver);

and then in `Hermes::rhs` the components are run by a call::

  scheduler->transform(state);

The call to `ComponentScheduler::create` treats the "components"
option as a comma-separated list of names. The order of the components
is the order that they are run in. For each name in the list, the
scheduler looks up the options under the section of that name. 

.. code-block:: ini

   [hermes]
   components = component1, component2

   [component1]

   # options to control component1

   [component2]

   # options to control component2

This would create two `Component` objects, of type `component1` and
`component2`. Each time `Hermes::rhs` is run, the `transform`
functions of `component1` amd then `component2` will be called,
followed by their `finally` functions.

It is often useful to group components together, for example to
define the governing equations for different species. A `type` setting
in the option section overrides the name of the section, and can be another list
of components

.. code-block:: ini

   [hermes]
   components = group1, component3

   [group1]
   type = component1, component2
   
   # options to control component1 and component2

   [component3]

   # options to control component3

This will create three components, which will be run in the order
`component1`, `component2`, `component3`: First all the components
in `group1`, and then `component3`.

Tests
--------------

The specification of the Toro tests used here is taken from
`Walker (2012) <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0039999>`_,
originally from Toro's book `Riemann Solvers and Numerical Methods for
Fluid Dynamics <https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/b79761>`_.

1D fluid (MMS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``tests/integrated/1D-fluid``

This convergence test using the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS)
solves fluid equations in the pressure form:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \frac{\partial n}{\partial t} &= -\nabla\cdot\left(n\mathbf{b}v_{||}\right) \\
   \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} &= -\nabla\cdot\left(p\mathbf{b}v_{||}\right) - \frac{2}{3}p\nabla\cdot\left(\mathbf{b}v_{||}\right) \\
   \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(mnv_{||}\right) &= -\nabla\cdot\left(nv_{||}\mathbf{b}v_{||}\right) - \partial_{||}p
   \end{aligned}

Sod shock
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``tests/integrated/sod-shock`` and ``tests/integrated/sod-shock-energy``

Euler equations in 1D. Starting from a state with a jump at the middle
of the domain.  Left state density, velocity and pressure are
:math:`\left(\rho_L, u_L, p_L\right) = \left(1.0, 0, 1.0\right)` Right
state :math:`\left(\rho_R, u_R, p_R\right) = \left(0.125, 0,
0.1\right)`. The result is shown in figure below at time :math:`t =
0.2` for different resolutions in a domain of length 1. The solid
black line is the analytic solution.

.. figure:: figs/sod_shock.png
   :name: sod_shock
   :alt:
   :width: 60%

When evolving pressure the position of the shock front lags the
analytic solution, with the pressure behind the front slightly too
high. This is a known consequence of solving the Euler equations in
non-conservative form. If instead we evolve energy (internal +
kinetic) then the result is much closer to the analytic solution.

Toro test 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``tests/integrated/toro-1``

Toro's test problem #1, from `Riemann Solvers and Numerical Methods
for Fluid Dynamics <https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/b79761>`_
is a variation of Sod's shock tube problem. The left state is moving
into the right, increasing the speed of the resulting shock. Left
state :math:`\left(\rho_L, u_L, p_L\right) = \left(1.0, 0.75,
1.0\right)` Right state :math:`\left(\rho_R, u_R, p_R\right) =
\left(0.125, 0, 0.1\right)`. The size of the domain is 5, and
the reference result is given at time :math:`t = 0.8`.

Toro test 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``tests/integrated/toro-2`` and ``tests/integrated/toro-2-energy``

Toro's test problem #2 tests robustness to diverging flows and near-zero densities.
The initial state has constant density and temperature, but a jump in velocity.
Left state :math:`\left(\rho_L, u_L, p_L\right) = \left(1.0, -2.0, 0.4\right)` Right
state :math:`\left(\rho_R, u_R, p_R\right) = \left(1.0, 2.0, 0.4\right)`. The result
in a domain of length 5 at time :math:`t=0.6` is shown below.

.. figure:: figs/toro-2.png
   :name: toro-2
   :alt:
   :width: 60%


Toro test 3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``tests/integrated/toro-3`` and ``tests/integrated/toro-3-energy``

Toro's test problem #3 contains a strong shock close to a contact
discontinuity.  Left initial state :math:`\left(\rho_L, u_L, p_L\right) =
\left(1.0, 0, 1000.0\right)` Right state :math:`\left(\rho_R, u_R,
p_R\right) = \left(1.0, 0, 0.01\right)`.  Time :math:`t = 0.04`.

When evolving pressure, the simulation is robust but the density peak
does not converge to the analytic solution (solid black line):

However by evolving energy the result converges towards the analytic
solution:

Toro test 4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``tests/integrated/toro-4`` and ``tests/integrated/toro-4-energy``

Toro's test problem #4 produces two right-going shocks with a contact
between them.  Left state :math:`\left(\rho_L, u_L, p_L\right) =
\left(5.99924, 19.5975, 460.894\right)` Right state
:math:`\left(\rho_R, u_R, p_R\right) = \left(5.99242, -6.19633,
46.0950\right)`.  Result at time :math:`t = 0.15`.

Toro test 5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``tests/integrated/toro-5`` and ``tests/integrated/toro-5-energy``

The initial conditions for Toro's test problem #5 are the same as test
#3, but the whole system is moving to the left at a uniform speed. The
velocity is chosen so that the contact discontinuity remains almost
stationary at the initial jump location.  Left state
:math:`\left(\rho_L, u_L, p_L\right) = \left(1, -19.59745,
1000.0\right)` Right state :math:`\left(\rho_R, u_R, p_R\right) =
\left(1, -19.59745, 0.01\right)`.  Result at time :math:`t = 0.03`.

Drift wave
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``tests/integrated/drift-wave``

This calculates the growth rate and frequency of a resistive drift
wave with finite electron mass. 

The equations solved are:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \frac{\partial n_i}{\partial t} =& -\nabla\cdot\left(n_i\mathbf{v}_{E\times B}\right) \\
   n_e =& n_i \\
   \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\nabla\cdot\left(\frac{n_0 m_i}{B^2}\nabla_\perp\phi\right) =& \nabla_{||}J_{||} = -\nabla_{||}\left(en_ev_{||e}\right) \\
   \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(m_en_ev_{||e}\right) =& -\nabla\cdot\left(m_en_ev_{||e} \mathbf{b}v_{||e}\right) + en_e\partial_{||}\phi - \partial_{||}p_e - 0.51\nu_{ei}n_im_ev_{||e}
   \end{aligned}

Linearising around a stationary background with constant density :math:`n_0` and temperature :math:`T_0`,
using :math:`\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\rightarrow -i\omega` gives:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \tilde{n} =& \frac{k_\perp}{\omega}\frac{n_0}{BL_n}\tilde{\phi} \\
   \tilde{\phi} =& -\frac{k_{||}}{\omega k_\perp^2}\frac{eB^2}{m_i}\tilde{v_{||e}} \\
   \omega m_e \tilde{v_{||e}} =& -ek_{||}\tilde{\phi} + ek_{||}\frac{T_o}{n_0}\tilde{n} - i0.51\nu_{ei}m_e\tilde{v_{||e}}
   \end{aligned}


where the radial density length scale coming from the radial
:math:`E\times B` advection of density is defined as

.. math::

   \frac{1}{L_n} \equiv \frac{1}{n_0}\frac{\partial n_0}{\partial r}

Substituting and rearranging gives:

.. math::

   i\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega*}\right)^3 \frac{\omega_*}{0.51\nu_{ei}} = \left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_*} - 1\right)\frac{i\sigma_{||}}{\omega_*} + \left(\frac{\omega}{\omega*}\right)^2

or

.. math::

   \frac{\omega_*}{0.51\nu_{ei}}\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_*}\right)^3 + i\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_*}\right)^2 - \frac{\sigma_{||}}{\omega_*}\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_*}\right) + \frac{\sigma_{||}}{\omega_*} = 0

where

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \omega_* =& \frac{k_\perp T_0}{BL_n} \\
   \sigma_{||} =& \frac{k_{||}^2}{k_\perp^2}\frac{\Omega_i\Omega_e}{0.51\nu_{ei}} \\
   \Omega_s =& eB / m_s
   \end{aligned}

This is a cubic dispersion relation, so we find the three roots (using
NumPy), and choose the root with the most positive growth rate
(imaginary component of :math:`\omega`).

Alfven wave
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The equations solved are

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\nabla\cdot\left(\frac{n_0 m_i}{B^2}\nabla_\perp\phi\right) =& \nabla_{||}J_{||} = -\nabla_{||}\left(en_ev_{||e}\right) \\
   \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(m_en_ev_{||e} - en_eA_{||}\right) =& -\nabla\cdot\left(m_en_ev_{||e} \mathbf{b}v_{||e}\right) + en_e\partial_{||}\phi - 0.51\nu_{ei}n_im_ev_{||e} \\
   J_{||} =& \frac{1}{\mu_0}\nabla_\perp^2 A_{||}
   \end{aligned}

Linearising around a stationary background with constant density
:math:`n_0` and temperature :math:`T_0`, using
:math:`\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\rightarrow -i\omega` gives:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \tilde{\phi} =& -\frac{k_{||}}{\omega k_\perp^2}\frac{eB^2}{m_i}\tilde{v_{||e}} \\
   \omega \left( m_e \tilde{v_{||e}} - e\tilde{A}_{||}\right) =& -ek_{||}\tilde{\phi} - i0.51\nu_{ei}m_e\tilde{v_{||e}} \\
   en_0\tilde{v_{||e}} =& -\frac{k_\perp^2}{\mu_0}\tilde{A}_{||}
   \end{aligned}

Rearranging results in a quadratic dispersion relation:

.. math::

   \omega^2\left(1 + \frac{k_\perp^2 c^2}{\omega_{pe}^2}\right) + i 0.51\nu_{ei}\frac{k_\perp^2 c^2}{\omega_{pe}^2}\omega - k_{||}^2V_A^2 = 0

where :math:`V_A = B / \sqrt{\mu_0 n_0 m_i}` is the Alfven speed, and
:math:`c / \omega_{pe} = \sqrt{m_e / \left(\mu_0 n_0 e^2\right)}` is
the electron skin depth.

When collisions are neglected, we obtain the result

.. math::

   \omega^2 = V_A^2\frac{k_{||}^2}{1 + k_\perp^2 c^2 / \omega_{pe}^2}
